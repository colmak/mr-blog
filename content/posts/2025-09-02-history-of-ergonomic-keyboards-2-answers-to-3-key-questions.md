# History of Ergonomic Keyboards 2: Answers to 3 Key Questions

## Introduction to History of Ergonomic Keyboards 2

The history of ergonomic keyboards is essential for understanding how our interaction with technology has evolved to prioritize user comfort and health. This post delves into the development of ergonomic keyboards, answering three key questions about their definition, origins, and current popular options.

## What is an ergonomic keyboard?

An ergonomic keyboard is designed to minimize strain on the user's body while typing. These keyboards often feature a split layout, curved design, or adjustable angles to promote a more natural wrist and hand position. The goal is to reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) such as carpal tunnel syndrome and to enhance overall comfort during extended use.

## What was the oldest one?

The first ergonomic keyboard is widely recognized as the **Kinesis Advantage**, introduced in 1992. This keyboard featured a unique concave shape and a split design, aimed at reducing wrist strain. Although not the first keyboard to incorporate ergonomic principles, the Advantage set a standard for future designs, paving the way for more advanced ergonomic solutions.

## What are the popular options today?

Today, several ergonomic keyboards are popular among users seeking comfort and efficiency:

1. **Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard**: This model features a split design, cushioned palm rest, and a domed shape to promote a natural wrist position.
2. **Logitech Ergo K860**: Known for its curved layout and split design, this keyboard provides a comfortable typing experience and encourages a more natural posture.
3. **Kinesis Freestyle2**: This keyboard allows users to adjust the distance between the two halves, catering to individual preferences and reducing shoulder strain.

These models exemplify the ongoing innovation in ergonomic keyboard design, focusing on user comfort and health.

## Conclusion

In summary, ergonomic keyboards have come a long way since the introduction of the Kinesis Advantage. They play a crucial role in promoting better typing posture and reducing the risk of injuries. For those interested in improving their typing experience, exploring various ergonomic options can be a beneficial next step.
