- [1]Features[edit]The common QWERTY keyboard layout is credited to the mechanical typewriter designed by C.
- Latham Sholes and patented in 1878;[2] research indicates the layout may have been influenced by telegraph operators.
- [3] The offset in the columns between rows was designed to accommodate the physical links between each key and the internal mechanisms of the typewriter; as typing duties transitioned to electric (motorized) typewriters and then computers, the layout was retained to ease the transition for users that had already been trained to type.
